# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
(Pictures are from Firefox [Technically Librewolf])
First, choose your version of this. One is 'My Settings', which **may not** always represent my current settings, but has more than just the theme. The other is 'Just Catppuccin', which is literally, just Catppuccin.



Next, download your version from the releases page.



Next, click on the Scratch Addons icon (It may be hidden)

Next, click the settings cogwheel. (It should result in a new tab)
