# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
(Pictures are from Firefox [Technically Librewolf])
First, choose your flavours. There's Mocha, Macchiato (i always misspell that one), FrappÃ©, and Latte. That list is from Dark --> Light. (Only light mode is Latte) 


Next, download your version from the releases page.



Next, click on the Scratch Addons icon (It may be hidden)
